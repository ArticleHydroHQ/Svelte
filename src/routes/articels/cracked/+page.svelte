<p>Cracked, or officially known as online-mode in minecraft server.properties is a setting that allows players to join a server without being checked against the Mojang authentication servers. This can also be used to allow cracked players to join the game.<br><br> </p>
<p class="font-bold text-xl">There is no premium minecraft. This would imply the existence of a free version, which Mojang does not offer. ALWAYS buy the game and do not use illegal, pirated launchers such as TLauncher.<br><br></p>
<p class="text-center text-2xl">Risks of using cracked</p>
<p>Cracked is deeply insecure and allows for many exploits. Itâ€™s important to note all of these before deciding to open your server to these risks without the necessary measures. <i><b>Again, we advise against turning cracked on for your server.<b><i></p>
